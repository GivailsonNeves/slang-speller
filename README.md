# Spelling Words

Application for practicing english spelling.

## Instructions

You can play as you want, the game will count how many questions you answered and mark the total that you solved in the first try:
- If you miss the spelling, the system will show the correct spelling, and you will be able to try again.
- If you are correct when you click to close the feedback, the system will present the next question.
- Any time you can go to the next question, but the system will not count the first try for that one.

## Spelling modes

You can try organizing the letters by dragging dropping or typing, there's a switch for it. In mobile versions you only be able to typing.
